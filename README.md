# god-vs-ets-uatx
A study on belief in God versus belief in extraterrestrials. See AdamDeng.com/essays/belief.html for more details.

The first section "ETs", "God", or "" tells you which type of plot is being produced. If "", it's a comparison of belief in God versus belief in ETs.

Then a specific categorization (age, gender, education) is stated, along with the subcategory (e.g. age -> 18-24).

There are also plots to include all respondents.

Very few of the 222 total respondents did not include age/gender/education, though these questions were optional.

To protect privacy, the original survey responses are not included here.

Code for generating plots is included in 'find_particular.py'.
